This is a controller inspired by the Sony's DualShock 3.
It has Twin Thumb Sticks, an accelerometer, buttons, and is wireless.
This project uses a bluetooth module for wireless conectivity.

This project uses FreeRTOS to power it
As a result, most of the files here are not my own code but rather FreeRTOS.
I created main.c and accelerometer.h

The accelerometer used is the AdaFruit LIS3DH.
I used HC-05 bluetooth modules for connectivity.
The Thumbsticks are Paralax 2-Axis joysticks.

I will update this README when I have a video demonstration.
